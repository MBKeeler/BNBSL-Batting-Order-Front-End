## README for front-end: Youth Baseball Batting Order Tracker:

As a member and volunteer of my youth Baseball league we need a better way of
creating batting orders for teams on a seasonal basis.  Right now we use
paper and often the batting order are generated by hand just before a game.
The goal of this project will be to provide an option for entering a batting order
and then provide a means of keeping the data saved.

A secondary goal of the project is to lay the ground work for creating a suite
of 'easy-to-use' tools for our league coaches.

## Third Party Integration: Chatwee
Chatwee is a third party who provides chat service at a low to no cost basis.
Integration with Chatwee may be as simple as including a script tag in each
page of the league website.  Chatwee provides basic chat features which also
include file transfer.  This site uses the simplist integration, but may in the
future use more advanced integration features.

The user will notice a chat icon or chat window located in the lower half of the
screen upon landing on the site. Administration of the Chatwee features is done
in a secure dashboard that is completely separate from this project.
